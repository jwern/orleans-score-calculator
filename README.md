# Orléans Score Calculator

This is a simple calculator for use with the board game Orléans. It allows players to input their owned items at the end of a game and get back their total score.

Many items in Orléans are multiplied by some set value to determine their total endgame score: for instance, each wine tile is worth 3 points while brocade is worth 5 apiece. This calculator will automatically multiply individual items by their respective values and then provide the player's total score.

## WIP

This calculator is a work-in-progress: the basic functionality is in place, but it is still being updated to improve the UI and appearance.

Functionality still to be added:

- Allow player to input coins based on total value **or** total number of each type of coin
- Add Trade & Intrigue Expansion scoring options (Orders, building tiles)
